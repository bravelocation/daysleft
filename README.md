Count The Days Left is a simple, elegant iOS app that does just one thing - counts the days between the start and 
    end date of an event or project, and how far along you've progressed so far.

It's optimised around your work tasks, as you can decide to count just weekdays if required.

I've also added a nice widget for the Today notification screen, for quick access to your progress, as well as an Apple Watch app and complication.

**The app was written as part of a &quot;develop in the open&quot; project, so if you're interested you can read more at [http://bravelocation.com/countthedaysleft](http://bravelocation.com/countthedaysleft)**
