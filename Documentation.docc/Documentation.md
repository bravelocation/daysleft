# Count The Days Left

Count The Days Left is a simple, elegant iOS app that does just one thing - counts the days between the start and 
    end date of an event or project, and how far along you've progressed so far.

It's optimised around your work tasks, as you can decide to count just weekdays if required.

I've also added support for widgets (on your home and lock screens), as well as an Apple Watch app and complications, plus Siri Shortcuts support.
